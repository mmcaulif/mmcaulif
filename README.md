## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is Manus. I am a budding researcher with a varied range of interests and skills. At the moment, I am particularly interested in plasticity in deep reinforcement learning (RL), but also (possibly) related phenomena like tandem effect, primacy bias, policy churn, catastrophic forgetting. Broader interests are reinforcement learning, computer vision, mathematics, programming to name a few. I attended Trinity College Dublin where I graduated with a masters and bachelors in engineering.

Currently:
* Research Engineer at [Instadeep](https://www.instadeep.com/research/) (applied reinforcement learning)
  
Previously:
* Intern Research Engineer at [Instadeep](https://www.instadeep.com/research/) (large-scale RL, protein language models, quantum machine learning)
* Intern Research Engineer at [Sony AI](https://ai.sony) (offline RL, continuous control, robotics)
* Intern Machine Learning Engineer at [Provizio](https://provizio.ai) (convolutional/recurrent/transformer architectures, supersampling)
* Research Assistant [TCD Electronic Engineering Department](https://www.tcd.ie/eleceng/) (cyberphysical systems, optimal control)
* Team Lead for Reinforcement Learning in [Formula Trinity Autonomous](https://ie.linkedin.com/company/formula-trinity)
