## Hey ðŸ‘‹

My Name is Manus. I am an AI researcher. I am particularly interested in failure modes and related phenomena in deep reinforcement learning (plasticity, policy churn, tandem effect, catastrophic forgetting). Broader interests are foundational models, programming, mathematics etc. I attended Trinity College Dublin where I graduated with a masters and bachelors in engineering.

Currently:
* Member of Technical Staff at [Microsoft AI]([https://www.instadeep.com/research/](https://microsoft.ai/)) (LLMs + reinforcement learning)
  
Previously:
* Research Engineer at [Instadeep](https://www.instadeep.com/research/) (large-scale RL, protein language models, quantum machine learning)
* Intern Research Engineer at [Sony AI](https://ai.sony) (offline RL, continuous control, robotics)
* Intern Machine Learning Engineer at [Provizio](https://provizio.ai) (convolutional/recurrent/transformer architectures, supersampling)
* Research Assistant [TCD Electronic Engineering Department](https://www.tcd.ie/eleceng/) (cyberphysical systems, optimal control)
* Team Lead for Reinforcement Learning in [Formula Trinity Autonomous](https://ie.linkedin.com/company/formula-trinity)
